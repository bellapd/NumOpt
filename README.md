# NumOpt: The Numerical Optimization Series
Welcome to NumOpt, the Numerical Optimization Series where we break down the complex world of optimization algorithms into fun, digestible bits! If you've ever wondered how mathematics helps us make the best choices in the most efficient way, you're in the right place. Even if you're new to the subject, fear not - our mission is to make these concepts as simple as can be, so simple that even a toddler could grasp the basics with a little help!

## What is Numerical Optimization?

Numerical Optimization is all about finding the best solution to a problem out of all possible solutions. It's like looking for the highest point on a hilly landscape or the lowest point in a valley – but using math and algorithms to do so.

## In This Series

- **Optimization 101**: We start with the basics. What is a function? What does it mean to optimize one?
- **The Land of Algorithms**: Dive into the colorful world of optimization algorithms. From Gradient Descent to Newton's Method, we've got the maps you need.
- **Python in Practice**: See these concepts come to life with Python. Code snippets and applications that you can run right away.
- **Real-World Quests**: Explore how optimization is used in real life, from rocket launches to baking the perfect cake.
- **Toddler's Corner**: Special section where complex topics are explained with analogies and stories fit for a toddler's understanding.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bellapd/NumOpt.git
```

Navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd NumOpt
```

And start exploring the chapters. Each folder corresponds to a section in the series, complete with explanations and Python scripts.

## Prerequisites

- A sprinkle of curiosity
- Basic knowledge of Python (helpful but not required)
- An eagerness to learn something new every day!

## Contributing

Got a fun analogy that would help a toddler understand optimization? Want to share a cool application of numerical optimization? Contributions are more than welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.

Let's embark on this journey together – happy optimizing!
